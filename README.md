autonomous law disclosure and disclaimer template (lawyer version)

***DISCLAIMERS FOLLOW: Please review and be advised of the following:*** 

I am a lawyer admitted to practice in New York and New Jersey (United States of America); 
  

**DISCLAIMER OF ATTORNEY – CLIENT RELATIONSHIP** 

Unless we have entered into a written engagement letter providing for paid legal services, I am not your lawyer and do not represent you or your interests and, in each case, such representation is qualified by any limitations set forth in such engagement letter, including with respect to scope. 

From time to time, I may engage in "autonomous lawyering," adhering to the principles further set forth here. When analyzing or discussing law or situations involving legal issues under the principles of autonomous lawyering should be construed as work product that is the result of representing myself or acting non-representationally in the context of belonging to a community of incentive-aligned supporters of a decentralized technology system. As such, no attorney-client relationship exists between myself and these communities and the persons in them are not my clients, should not rely on any work product produced, and will have no expectation of confidentiality (nor do I have any intention to treat their information as confidential) or that attorney-client privilege exists. Thus, in engaging in autonomous lawyering, and with respect to any work product produced, I am acting on my own behalf, whether or not such work product is produced by a community of like-minded individuals, but will seek to provide accurate and honest information with respect to my work product and my role while observing my general nonrepresentational professional responsibilities such as demonstrating respect for the legal system.  

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** 

For the avoidance of doubt, I assume no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in any work product that is a result of autonomous lawyering efforts. Any views expressed, analysis or other work product are provided “as is” for public discourse and discussion purposes only on matters of interest with no guarantees of completeness, accuracy, usefulness or timeliness and without warranty of any kind, express or implied. You are cautioned not to rely on, and if my work product in autonomous lawyering contexts proves to be inaccurate, there will be no legal recourse against me and an injured party will not be covered by malpractice insurance. 

As such, reviewing any work product reviewed should not be used as a substitute for consultation with professional accounting, tax, legal or other competent advisers.  In no event will I or my law firm, or the partners, agents or employees thereof be liable to you or anyone else for any decision made or action taken in reliance on the information in any work product or for any consequential, special or similar damages, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.   

**VIEWS EXPRESSED DISCLAIMER** 

In engaging in autonomous lawyering, I am not acting on behalf of my law firm or any other employer of mine, nor on behalf of my clients (i.e., those with whom I have signed engagement letters providing that I will act as their attorney).  Any views or opinions expressed in work product or otherwise in furtherance of autonomous lawyering are mine and do not reflect the opinions or views of my firm, or other employer or organization with which I am affiliated. 

I currently engage in autonomous lawyering in the following communities and have the following economic interests therein:  

* LeXpunk 

* lex_DAO
 
I also hold non-immaterial amounts (by portfolio %) of BTC, ETC, SOL, ALPHA, UNI, REN & various stablecoins. 

I disclaim any responsibility to keep these disclosures up to date, but currently anticipate updating them from time to time to reflect the changes I deem sufficiently material to warrant disclosure.
